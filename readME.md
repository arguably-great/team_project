# README Template

Your [design product spec](https://hackmd.io/s/H1wGpVUh7) (described in that link) will look like the following in your README:

## 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

**Required Must-have Stories**

 * Some sort of VideoViewer
 * Some sort of SolarSystemDetailViewer (maybe some 3D Models?)
 * Some sort of NotesApp (make it look nice/structured)
 * Be able to display all 3 "features" in the app
 * Incorporate AR into application for displaying all the information
 * Be able to interact with our AR "Features"

**Optional Nice-to-have Stories**

 * Natural Language Processing (give commands via speech)
 * Speech-to-Text (instead of needing to type)
 * Move/Resize Views
 * Adding/Removing Views
 * SceneForm stuff
 * Cloud AR Data Sharing
 * Way to showcase Notifications/Info
 * Somehow connect watch to AR Environment
 * Make visually appealing/connect to the theme

## 2. Screen Archetypes

 * Since this app is exclusively in AR, there aren't necessarily screens.
  * However, we have SceneForms that are rendered in the AR space
  * Each of the SceneForms will have their own features, and we'll have a consistent general theme for the views
